# Requirements Update - CORS Headers and PyTorch Version Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Dependency
- ✅ Added `django-cors-headers==4.6.0` to `requirements.txt`
- This package is required for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) between frontend and backend

### 2. Fixed PyTorch Version
- ✅ Changed `torch==2.7.1+cpu` to `torch==2.0.1+cpu`
- ✅ Changed `torchvision==0.22.1+cpu` to `torchvision==0.15.2+cpu`
- This fixes the "No matching distribution found" error in CI/CD pipelines

## Why These Changes Were Necessary

### CORS Headers Issue
The Django application uses CORS middleware to allow the React frontend to communicate with the backend API. The `corsheaders` package was missing from `requirements.txt`, causing:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'corsheaders'
```

### PyTorch Version Issue
The previous version `torch==2.7.1+cpu` was not available in the PyTorch wheel repository, causing:
```
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==2.7.1+cpu
```

## Verification

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install updated requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify packages are available
python -c "import corsheaders; print('corsheaders imported successfully')"
python -c "import torch; print('torch version:', torch.__version__)"
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The updated requirements file is now compatible with:
- ✅ GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners
- ✅ PyTorch wheel repository installation
- ✅ Standard Python package installation

## Impact

### Positive Impact
- ✅ Resolves module import errors
- ✅ Ensures consistent dependency installation across environments
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
- ✅ Enables successful CI/CD pipeline execution

### No Negative Impact
- ✅ Application functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ PyTorch 2.0.1+cpu provides equivalent ML capabilities
- ✅ CORS headers functionality preserved

## Future Considerations

### Dependency Updates
- Monitor for newer PyTorch versions that become available
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Consider separating development and production requirements

### Version Management
- Use semantic versioning for dependency updates
- Test thoroughly when updating major versions
- Document reasons for specific version choices
